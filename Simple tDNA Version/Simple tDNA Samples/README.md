# Simple tDNA Sample Session

## Program Session Example

This section provides a visual walkthrough of a typical session using the application.  

The screenshots below demonstrate how a user navigates through the menus, interacts with the interface, and how the system validates input and handles different requests.

This walkthrough is intended to help readers understand the program’s behavior and interface flow without having to run the program themselves.
